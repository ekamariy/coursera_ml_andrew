In particular, a model without regularization $\\left(\\lambda=0\\right)$ fits the training set well, but does not generalize. Conversely, a model with too much regularization $\\left(\\lambda=100\\right)$ does not fit the training set and testing set well. A good choice of $\\lambda$ $\\left(\\text{e.g., }\\lambda=0\\right)$ can provide a good fit to the data.\n",

    "In this section, an automated method to select the $\\lambda$ parameter will be implemented. Concretely, a cross validation set will be used to evaluate how good each $\\lambda$ value is. After selecting the best $\\lambda$ value using the cross validation set, then the model can be evaluated on the test set to estimate how well the model will perform on actual unseen data.\n",

Various values of $\\lambda$ in the following range: $\\left\\{0, 0.001, 0.003, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10\\right\\}$ will be tried.\n",

Due to randomness in the training and validation splits of the dataset, the cross validation error can sometimes be lower than the training error."
