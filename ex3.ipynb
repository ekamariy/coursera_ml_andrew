    "\n",
    "Automated handwritten digit recognition is widely used today - from recognizing zip codes (postal codes) on mail envelopes to recognizing amounts written on bank checks. In the first part, the previous implementation of logistic regression will be extended and applied to one-vs-all classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset in ex3data1.mat contains 5000 training examples of handwritten digits. The .mat format means that the data has been saved in a native Octave/MATLAB matrix format, instead of a text (ASCII) format like a csv-file. These matrices can be read by the `loadmat` module from `scipy`. After loading, matrices of the correct dimensions and values will appear in the program’s memory. The matrix will already be named, so there is no need to assign names to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5000 training examples in ex3data1.mat, where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector. Each of these training examples becomes a single row in our data matrix X. This gives us a 5000 by 400 matrix X where every row is a training example for a handwritten digit image.\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part of the training set is a 5000-dimensional vector y that contains labels for the training set. **Note:** To make things more compatible with Octave/MATLAB indexing, where there is no zero index, the digit zero have been mapped to the value ten. Therefore, a “0” digit is labeled as “10”, while the digits “1” to “9” are labeled as “1” to “9” in their natural order."
